1. Source Code: The set of instructions which are written in IDE & given to the computer for execution & get the output. It is saved as a '.java'.

2. Native Code: It is in the format of 0's & 1's. Which makes the processor run. All instructions to a processor are given in the form of Native Code.
   
Byte Code: Byte Code is generated after compiling the Source Code, which is not understandable by humans and Softwares. It makes JVMs run, which are present in any of the OS.

3. Explain how Java is both a compiled and interpreted language.
A: The Source code is compiled by the Compiler and converted to a byte code. The byte code is sent to JVM, and then it translates to Machine code. So, java is performing both Compilation & Interpretation to get to understand to the Machine
